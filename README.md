# MineCraft Server Website
 A little project I made in spite of discords' 8mb file upload.
 I do not plan on paying for Nitro so I made a website where I can easily upload my files to a google drive and share them via 1 link, ALWAYS!!!
 When changesa are made to the modpack, i just need to take the new modpack share link and make the download button on the page take them to the latest version.
